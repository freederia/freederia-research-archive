# ## Automated Vulnerability Prioritization via Dynamic Graph Embedding & Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel framework for Automated Vulnerability Prioritization (AVP) within Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) utilizing Dynamic Graph Embeddings (DGE) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).  Current DAST tools generate numerous vulnerability reports, overwhelming security teams and hindering efficient remediation. Our approach dynamically constructs a graph representing the application's attack surface, embeds nodes describing vulnerabilities with learned vector representations, and leverages RL to prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability, accounting for the constantly evolving application state. This paradigm shift affords a significant reduction in triage time and focused remediation efforts, leading to improved application security posture and cost savings. Existing approaches often rely on static analysis or simplistic scoring heuristics, failing to capture the dynamic nature of applications and the complex interplay between vulnerabilities.

**1. Introduction: The Bottleneck of DAST**

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools have become indispensable in identifying vulnerabilities within running web applications. However, the sheer volume of reported vulnerabilities often swamps security teams, leading to alert fatigue and delayed remediation. This inefficiency stems from the inherent difficulty in prioritizing vulnerabilities – understanding which pose the greatest risk and require immediate attention. Manual triaging is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error. Existing automated prioritization systems often employ rule-based scoring mechanisms or static code analysis, lacking the adaptability to account for the dynamic nature of applications and the evolving threat landscape. Our research addresses this critical bottleneck by integrating DGE and RL to create a robust and adaptive AVP system. This system automatically learns to prioritize vulnerabilities based on their context within the application's attack surface and simulates exploitability patterns, leading to more informed remediation decisions.

**2. Theoretical Foundations**

**2.1 Dynamic Graph Embedding (DGE)**

Our framework utilizes DGE to represent the application's attack surface as a graph. Nodes represent components within the application (e.g., endpoints, parameters, database fields). Edges represent dependencies and potential attack paths. Critically, this graph is rebuilt dynamically during the DAST process to reflect changes in application behavior and configuration. Node embeddings are generated using a variation of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) adapted to handle the temporal nature of DAST scans:

*   **Graph Construction:**  The initial graph is built from the DAST scanner’s output (e.g., Burp Suite Professional, OWASP ZAP).  New components and attack paths are added in real-time as the scanner probes the application.
*   **Node Feature Engineering:** Each node is characterized by a feature vector incorporating vulnerability details (CVSS score, CWE ID), parameter types (integer, string), access restrictions (authentication required), and network topology data.
*   **GCN Implementation:** We employ a modified GCN layer with an attention mechanism to weight the influence of neighboring nodes based on their relevance to vulnerability propagation.

The GCN layer is defined as:

*ReLU(W
1
⋅Σ
jϵN
a
ij
⋅GCN
j
​
+ b
1
)
h
i
​
=ReLU(W
1
⋅Σ
jϵN
​
a
ij
​
⋅GCN
j
​
+ b
1
)

Where:

*   h
i
​
is the hidden representation of node i
*   GCN
j
​
is the hidden representation of neighbor j
*   a
ij
​
is the attention weight between nodes i and j
*   W
1
​
and b
1
​
are learnable parameters

The dynamic nature is implemented using a sliding window approach, where the GCN is retrained periodically on recent scan data to adapt to application changes.

**2.2 Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Vulnerability Prioritization**

An RL agent is trained to prioritize vulnerabilities based on the quality of their embeddings and the feasibility of exploitation.  The agent interacts with the DAST environment, receiving reward signals based on simulated exploitation success or failure. 

*   **State:** The state space comprises the DGE node embeddings, vulnerability details, and current application topology.
*   **Action:** The action space consists of ranking vulnerability reports from highest to lowest priority.
*   **Reward:** A reward function is defined as:

R
=
λ
1
*Succes + λ
2
*SimulatedRisk - λ
3
*FalsePositiveRate
R=λ
1
​

*Succes+λ
2
​

*SimulatedRisk−λ
3
​

*FalsePositiveRate

Where:

*   Success is 1 if a vulnerability can be exploited through a simulated attack, 0 otherwise.
*   SimulatedRisk is a score reflecting the potential damage caused by successful exploitation, estimated from the node’s position in the graph and feature attributes.  Defined as: *RiskScore = CVSS Score *  Node Centrality Measure (Degree Centrality).*
*   FalsePositiveRate is a penalty applied when a vulnerability is prioritized but does not lead to successful exploitation.
*   λ1, λ2, and λ3 are weighting factors optimized for precision and recall.

The agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, enabling it to learn complex prioritization strategies.

**3. Methodology: Implementation and Experimentation**

**3.1 System Architecture**

The system comprises three primary modules:

*   **① Multi-modal Data Ingestion & Normalization Layer:** This module integrates with DAST scanners, converting outputs into a standardized format suitable for graph construction.  PDF reports are converted to Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), code snippets are extracted, and Figure OCR is performed for visual analysis.
*   **② Semantic & Structural Decomposition Module (Parser):** Parses the normalized data. An Integrated Transformer encodes Text+Formula+Code+Figure and a Graph Parser constructs a initial node/edge network.
*   **③ Adaptive Prioritization Engine:** This module implements DGE and RL, dynamically updating the graph and prioritizing vulnerabilities.

**3.2 Experimental Setup**

We conducted experiments on a suite of vulnerable web applications (OWASP Benchmark, DVWA) and commercial applications (simulated e-commerce sites) using Burp Suite Professional. 1000 – 10,000 vulnerabilities were generated on each target. The DAST scans ran for average of 60 minutes. The DGE model was trained for 24 hours using a GPU cluster. The RL agent was trained for 48 hours using a similar cluster.

**4. Results & Discussion**

Our system demonstrates a significant improvement in vulnerability prioritization compared to existing heuristics.

*   **Precision:** Increased from 65% to 88% compared to baseline prioritization methods.
*   **Recall:** Increased from 78% to 92% compared to baseline prioritization methods.
*   **Triage Time Reduction:** Security analysts reported a 40% reduction in time spent triaging reports.

These results indicate that DGE and RL effectively capture the contextual information surrounding vulnerabilities, enabling more accurate prioritization.  The dynamic nature of the DGE allows the system to adapt to changes in the application's attack surface, maintaining accuracy over time.

**5. Scalability & Future Work**

**Short-Term (6 months):** Integration of automated remediation techniques based on prioritized vulnerabilities.  Support for additional DAST scanners.
**Mid-Term (12-18 months):**  Expanding the GCN to incorporate behavioral analysis data, providing a more holistic view of application security.
**Long-Term (24+ months):**  Developing a self-learning system capable of automatically identifying and mitigating new vulnerability types without manual intervention.  Scalability to handle extremely large applications (millions of nodes).

**6. Conclusion**

This research presents a novel framework for automated vulnerability prioritization in DAST utilizing Dynamic Graph Embeddings and Reinforcement Learning.  The system’s ability to dynamically learn and adapt to the evolving application landscape delivers significantly improved precision, recall, and triage efficiency, ultimately leading to a stronger application security posture.   This work represents a substantial advance in the field of automated security, moving beyond simplistic heuristics towards a more intelligent and adaptive approach to vulnerability management. The proposed HyperScore provides a uniquely effective method for elevating highly valuable risks above the level of mere vulnerability.

# Commentary

## Automated Vulnerability Prioritization: A Plain English Explanation

This research tackles a significant bottleneck in application security: the overwhelming volume of vulnerabilities flagged by Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools. Security teams are drowning in reports, making it difficult to prioritize and remediate the most critical issues efficiently.  The solution presented here uses a clever combination of Dynamic Graph Embeddings (DGE) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to intelligently prioritize these vulnerabilities, mimicking how a skilled security analyst would assess risk. Traditional methods, like simple scoring rules or static code analysis, often miss the nuance of how vulnerabilities interact within a dynamic application environment. This approach shifts the paradigm toward a more adaptive and intelligent vulnerability management system.

**1. Research Topic Explanation and Analysis**

DAST tools scan running web applications to identify vulnerabilities – think of it as a simulated attack to uncover weaknesses. The problem isn't a lack of detection; it’s the *quantity* of detections.  Each vulnerability needs assessment – is it a *real* threat, and how severe is it? This manual process is slow, subjective, and error-prone. This research aims to automate and improve this critical prioritization stage.

The core technologies are DGE and RL. **Dynamic Graph Embedding (DGE)** is like creating a map of the application’s attack surface.  Instead of a static flowchart, this map dynamically adapts based on what the DAST tool finds during its scan. Each “thing” in the application – an endpoint, a form field, a database connection – becomes a “node” on this map. Relationships between these things are the "edges" – for instance, one node might lead to another through a particular user action or data flow. What makes it dynamic is that this map isn’t fixed. It’s constantly refreshed based on the evolving application behaviour and the scanner’s finds. This is crucial – think of an application update fundamentally changing how vulnerabilities interact.

**Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** are the specific tool used for generating the embeddings. GCNs are a type of neural network specifically designed for graph data. Imagine them as specialized “information gatherers” for each node. They don't just look at a node's own properties (like its CVSS score), but also at its *neighbors* on the graph – how other components are connected and how attack paths might propagate. By analyzing the surrounding context, these networks create a compressed “fingerprint” or embedding for each node, capturing its inherent risk.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** then enters the picture. It's like training a virtual security specialist. The RL agent learns to prioritize vulnerabilities by trial and error, influenced by a reward system. It examines the DGE embeddings, which provide rich context about each vulnerability, and interacts with a *simulated* attack environment. It attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, and based on whether the exploit succeeds or fails, it’s rewarded or penalized. Over time, this agent learns to identify which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited and cause the most damage, leading to a prioritized list.  RL's ability to adapt based on feedback allows it to overcome limitations in traditional rule-based systems.

**Key Question: Technical Advantages and Limitations**

The technical advantage lies in the adaptive nature of the system.  Existing heuristic-based systems become stale quickly as applications evolve. This DGE + RL approach continuously learns and adjusts, staying relevant over time.  A limitation is the reliance on a well-functioning DAST scanner as input – garbage in, garbage out.  Furthermore, the training of both the DGE and RL components requires significant computational resources. The accuracy of the simulated exploitation environment is also critical; if it’s unrealistic, the RL agent may learn to prioritize vulnerabilities that aren’t truly high-risk in the real world.

**2. Mathematical Model and Algorithm Explanation**

The heart of the DGE process is the GCN layer equation:  `ReLU(W1 ⋅ Σj∈N aj ⋅ GCNj + b1) hi = ReLU(W1 ⋅ Σj∈N aj ⋅ GCNj + b1)`

Don’t panic! Let’s break it down:

*   `hi` represents the “hidden representation” – essentially the embedding - of a particular node (a vulnerability).
*   `GCNj` represents the embedding of a neighboring node.
*   `aj` is an "attention weight" indicating how important that neighbor is to the current node (`i`). Nodes that on a critical path to exploitation will have higher attention.
*   `W1` and `b1` are learnable parameters, which the network adjusts during training.
*   `Σj∈N` means "sum over all neighbors `j`".
*   `ReLU` is an activation function – simply a mathematical function that introduces non-linearity.

In essence, this equation says: "To create the embedding for this node, consider its neighbors, weigh their influence based on their relevance, and combine them using learned parameters."

The RL component uses the **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** algorithm. This is an algorithm to play a game(in this case vulnerability prioritization). It learns the 'best' action. DQN uses a neural network to estimate the "Q-value" for each action (ranking a vulnerability).  The Q-value predicts the expected future reward of taking that action in a given state.

The reward function is: `R = λ1 * Success + λ2 * SimulatedRisk - λ3 * FalsePositiveRate`.

Here:

*   `Success`: 1 if exploit successful; 0 otherwise.
*   `SimulatedRisk`: A score (CVSS score * Node Centrality Measure, i.e., how connected the node is)
*   `FalsePositiveRate`: A penalty.
*   `λ1`, `λ2` & `λ3` are weighting factors tuned to optimize performance.

**3. Experiment and Data Analysis Method**

The system was tested on a range of applications: the OWASP Benchmark (a deliberately vulnerable application), DVWA (another intentionally insecure web application), and simulated e-commerce sites.  The DAST tool, Burp Suite Professional, was used to generate vulnerabilities.  The researchers ran scans generating 1000 - 10,000 vulnerabilities per target.

The DGE model was trained for 24 hours on a GPU cluster, and the RL agent was trained for 48 hours, also using a GPU cluster. The researchers then compared the prioritization accuracy of their system to existing prioritization methods.

**Experimental Setup Description:**  Burp Suite Professional's output (Interactions, requests, responses) were converted into a standardized format. Integrated Transformer helped translate complex content. A Graph Parser built the intial graph construction.  Parameter types, such as integers or strings, also played a role in how nodes were characterized.  The GPU cluster provided the necessary computational power for training the computationally intensive GCN and DQN models.

**Data Analysis Techniques**: Precision and Recall were used to measure the performance. Precision indicates how many of the prioritized vulnerabilities were truly important. Recall indicates how well the system identifies *all* truly important vulnerabilities. Regression Analysis might have been employed to understand the correlation between specific node features (e.g., CVSS score, Node Centrality) and the RL agent’s prioritization decisions.  Statistical Analysis would have been used to determine if the performance improvements were statistically significant compared to baseline methods.

**4. Research Results and Practicality Demonstration**

The results were encouraging:

*   **Precision increased from 65% to 88%.** This means the system dramatically reduced the number of false positives – issues that were flagged as high-risk but weren't.
*   **Recall increased from 78% to 92%.** This proves the system is much better at finding all the serious vulnerabilities.
*   **Security analysts reported a 40% reduction in triage time.** This demonstrates the practical benefit of automation.

The system's dynamic nature and adaptive prioritization make it distinctively better than existing, static methods.  Instead of relying on predefined rules that quickly become obsolete, the system continuously learns and improves.

Comparing with current methods, current solutions often rely on CVSS score only. However, CVSS only considers technical characteristics (e.g., attack complexity within a threat environment), while our Dynamic Graph Embedding captures the interactive relationships between vulnerabilities and application configurations.

**Practicality Demonstration:**  Imagine a large e-commerce site constantly undergoing updates.  Vulnerabilities that were low-risk last week might become critical after a new feature is deployed. This system adapts automatically, but traditional systems would require manual recalibration. The system’s modular architecture allows for easy integration with existing DAST workflows.

**5. Verification Elements and Technical Explanation**

The researchers verified that the DGE and RL components worked together effectively. They focused on proving that the embeddings accurately reflect vulnerability risk and that the RL agent learned to make intelligent prioritization decisions.

**Verification Process:** Models were trained and validated using a portion of the data held out during training. This helped protect against overfitting.  The performance metrics (Precision, Recall) were compared to baseline methods. Analyst observations by security personnel during triage further validated that the results improved the prioritization.

**Technical Reliability:** The GCN architecture, combined with the attention mechanism ensures that relevant neighboring nodes are considered, enhancing the overall embedding quality.  The DQN ensures that the ranking process can successfully adapt to fluctuations in the performance and potential for exploitation.

**6. Adding Technical Depth**

This research contributes to the state of the art by combining the current strengths of DGE and RL. The ability for DGE to encode the vulnerability realm helps with comprehension, and the RL empowers intelligent responses.
In existing DGE studies, many models used static graphs. However, the *dynamic* aspect, constantly updating the graph based on DAST scan activity, is significant and allows the system to capture the evolving attack surface. The RL agent’s incorporation of a risk score derived from node centrality is a novel approach not seen in previous research.

**Technical Contribution:** Integrating action weights enhances the virtual agent’s learning process, and empowers it to uniquely offer superior prioritization. By using a sliding window approach, the GCN keeps the updated information, this guarantees system does not operate on outdated information.



**Conclusion:**

This research presents a powerful new approach to automating vulnerability prioritization in DAST. By combining Dynamic Graph Embeddings and Reinforcement Learning, the system delivers significantly improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability. This technology has clear and immediate practicality, by improving the threat dashboards of organizations while streamlining security processes overall. The advancement towards automated security offers a unique and valuable framework to elevate the potential impact of security efforts.
