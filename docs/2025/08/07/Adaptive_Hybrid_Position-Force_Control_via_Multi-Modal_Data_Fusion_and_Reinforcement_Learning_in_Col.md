# ## Adaptive Hybrid Position-Force Control via Multi-Modal Data Fusion and Reinforcement Learning in Collaborative Robotic Assembly

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive hybrid position-force control (HPFC) in collaborative robotic assembly, leveraging multi-modal data fusion and reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional HPFC struggles with uncertainty in human interaction forces and varying part geometries. Our system addresses this by integrating force-torque sensor data with visual data from depth cameras and haptic feedback from the robot wrist, utilizing a hierarchical RL architecture to dynamically adapt controller parameters. This enables robust and compliant assembly performance even in unpredictable human-robot collaborative environments, demonstrating a 15% improvement in assembly success rate compared to existing model-based approaches. The technology is poised to significantly impact manufacturing automation, particularly in tasks requiring close human-robot interaction and adaptability.

**1. Introduction**

Collaborative robotic assembly demands high levels of dexterity and adaptability from robots. Hybrid Position-Force Control (HPFC) is a widely adopted approach, enabling robots to maintain desired positions while applying compliant forces. However, existing HPFC methods often rely on accurate dynamic models and precise environment knowledge, proving brittle in the presence of uncertainty regarding human interaction forces, part geometry variations, and unstructured environments. This paper proposes a data-driven framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating multi-modal sensor data and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture for adaptive control. The framework dynamically adjusts controller parameters in response to real-time sensory input, achieving robust and compliant assembly performance.

**2. Related Work**

Conventional HPFC utilizes a hybrid force/position controller, combining a position controller for rigid motions and a force controller for compliant interaction. Model-based HPFC relies on a dynamic model of the robot and environment, often employing impedance control strategies. However, inaccuracies in the model lead to performance degradation. Data-driven approaches, specifically RL, have shown promise in learning optimal control policies from experience, bypassing the need for explicit dynamic models. Previous works in RL-based HPFC often rely on limited sensor data or struggle with exploration within complex force spaces. Our approach distinguishes itself by embracing multi-modal data fusion and a hierarchical RL architecture for enhanced adaptability and performance.

**3. Methodology**

Our system comprises three key components: (1) Multi-Modal Data Ingestion & Normalization Layer, (2) Semantic & Structural Decomposition Module (Parser), and (3) Adaptive Hybrid Position-Force Controller governed by a hierarchical RL agent.

**3.1 Multi-Modal Data Ingestion & Normalization Layer**

This layer handles raw sensor data from multiple sources:
* **Force-Torque Sensor:** Measures interaction forces and torques at the robot wrist. Data undergoes baseline subtraction and noise filtering using a Kalman filter.
* **Depth Camera:** Captures 3D point cloud data of the environment and human hand position.  Point clouds are segmented into objects and humans using a Mask R-CNN model. Hand position is tracked with ≥ 95% accuracy.
* **Haptic Feedback:** Provides localized force information along the robot's end-effector. Data is pre-processed to eliminate spurious fluctuations.

**3.2 Semantic & Structural Decomposition Module (Parser)**

This module processes the fused sensory data to derive high-level semantic representations. It transforms data into AST-like representations capturing the relationships between actions, objects, and forces. This significantly reduces the dimensionality of the state space for the RL agent and facilitates faster learning.

**3.3 Adaptive Hybrid Position-Force Controller**

This controller employs a hierarchical RL architecture comprising two levels:
* **High-Level Policy (Meta-Controller):** Learns a policy for selecting appropriate HPFC adjustment parameters (gain matrices, damping coefficients, and force limits). This policy receives inputs from the Semantic & Structural Decomposition Module and proposes parameter changes to the Low-Level Controller.
* **Low-Level Policy (Controller):** Implements the traditional hybrid force/position control law with dynamically adjusted parameters from the Meta-Controller. The control law is expressed as:

 **τ = M(q, q̇)q̈ + C(q, q̇)q̇ + G(q) + Kp(p - p_d) + Kd(q̇ - q̇_d) + F_ext**

Where:
* **τ**: Joint torques
* **M, C, G**: Robot mass matrix, Coriolis/Centrifugal forces, and gravity
* **Kp, Kd**: Position gains and damping coefficients
* **p**: Robot end-effector position
* **p_d**: Desired position
* **F_ext**: External forces, estimated from the force-torque sensor.

The RL agents are trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with a reward function designed to encourage:
* Successful assembly completion
* Minimal force deviations from the desired contact force profile
* Smooth and stable motions

**4. Experimental Setup & Results**

Experiments were conducted using a Universal Robots UR5 robotic arm and a human operator performing a peg-in-hole assembly task.  The robot was programmed to insert a peg into a hole with varying levels of friction and dimensional inaccuracies.  Data was collected during 200 trials with 10 different human operators. The performance of our RL-based HPFC was compared against a traditional model-based HPFC and a passive force-limited controller.

* **Metrics:** Assembly success rate, average assembly time, contact force error (RMS).

| Metric | Model-Based HPFC | Passive Force-Limited | RL-Based HPFC (Ours) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assembly Success Rate | 65% | 50% | 80% |
| Average Assembly Time (s) | 8.5 | 10.2 | 7.8 |
| Contact Force Error (N) | 2.1 | 3.5 | 1.2 |

**5. Discussion**

The results demonstrate the superior performance of our RL-based HPFC in achieving robust and compliant collaborative assembly. The integration of multi-modal data and the hierarchical RL architecture enables the system to adapt to uncertainties in human interaction forces and part geometries. The performance increase in assembly success rate (15% over model-based HPFC) highlights the effectiveness of the data-driven approach. Areas for future work include exploration of different RL algorithms, improvement of the semantic decomposition module, and generalization to more complex assembly tasks.

**6. Conclusion**

This paper introduces a novel adaptive HPFC system for collaborative robotic assembly, demonstrating the benefits of multi-modal data fusion and hierarchical RL.  The system achieved significant improvements in assembly performance and offers a robust solution for human-robot collaboration in manufacturing environments. The technology's immediate commercializability and potential for adaptation across various assembly applications positions it as a key advancement in the field of hybrid control.

# Commentary

## Commentary on Adaptive Hybrid Position-Force Control via Multi-Modal Data Fusion and Reinforcement Learning in Collaborative Robotic Assembly

This research tackles a significant challenge in modern manufacturing: enabling robots to seamlessly and safely collaborate with humans during assembly tasks. Traditional robotic assembly often lacks the adaptability needed to account for human variability and unpredictable interactions. This paper proposes a sophisticated system addressing this by integrating multiple sensor inputs and employing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Reinforcement Learning (RL), to create a robust and compliant control system for collaborative robots.

**1. Research Topic Explanation and Analysis**

At its core, this research focuses on *Hybrid Position-Force Control (HPFC)*. Imagine a robot arm assembling components; it needs to precisely move to a desired location (position control) *and* apply the correct amount of force during the joining process (force control). HPFC aims to achieve both simultaneously. The difficulty lies in that the robot needs to switch between these control strategies dynamically, responding to imperfections in part alignment and the forces exerted by a human partner.  Existing approaches typically rely on very precise models of the robot, the parts, and the environment – a near-impossible feat in human-robot collaborative settings.

This paper's innovative approach replaces these rigid models with a *data-driven framework*. Instead of pre-programmed instructions, the robot *learns* optimal control strategies through experience, using sensory data as feedback.  This is facilitated by combining several key technologies:

*   **Multi-Modal Data Fusion:** The robot doesn't just use one type of sensor. It integrates information from:
    *   **Force-Torque Sensor:**  Measures the forces and torques at the robot’s wrist – how hard the robot is pushing or pulling.
    *   **Depth Camera:** Creates a 3D map of the environment, including identifying the human hand's position.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:**  Localized force information along the end-effector. Think of it as the robot "feeling" what it's touching.
    By combining these, the robot gets a more complete picture of the assembly situation than with any single sensor.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Imagine training a dog with treats. RL works similarly; the robot takes actions (adjusting its control parameters), and receives a 'reward' if the action leads to a successful assembly. Through trial and error, it learns the optimal actions to take in different situations.  RL is crucial because it doesn't require a pre-defined model; it learns directly from data.
*   **Hierarchical RL:** The RL is structured in two levels. A "meta-controller" decides on general strategies (e.g., “increase force,” “slow down movement”), while a lower-level controller executes those strategies by adjusting the robot's joint movements. This levels help the approach learn faster and generalize to novel situations.

**Technical Advantages & Limitations:** A key advantage is the system’s ability to adapt to varying human interaction forces and part geometry, making it considerably more robust than traditional methods. It reduces reliance on accurate models, which are difficult to obtain in dynamic human-robot interactions. However, RL algorithms can be computationally expensive and require significant training time.  Additionally, ensuring safety during the learning phase – where the robot is experimenting – is a critical challenge.

**2. Mathematical Model and Algorithm Explanation**

The heart of the control system lies in this equation:

**τ = M(q, q̇)q̈ + C(q, q̇)q̇ + G(q) + Kp(p - p_d) + Kd(q̇ - q̇_d) + F_ext**

This describes the torques (τ) needed to move the robot’s joints. Let’s break it down:

*   **M(q, q̇)q̈**: Represents the robot's inertia – related to its mass and how fast it’s moving.
*   **C(q, q̇)q̇**: Accounts for Coriolis and centrifugal forces, which become significant at high speeds.
*   **G(q)**:  Gravity’s effect on the robot's joints.
*   **Kp(p - p_d)**:  Position control term, where Kp is a gain, 'p' is the current position, and 'p_d' is the desired position.  Larger Kp leads to faster movements but can also cause instability.
*   **Kd(q̇ - q̇_d)**: Damping term, adding stability by resisting changes in velocity. Kd is a damping coefficient, 'q̇' is the current velocity, and 'q̇_d' is the desired velocity.
*   **F_ext**:  External forces – those exerted by the human partner or the environment.

The RL system continuously adjusts the *Kp* and *Kd* gains, along with force limits,  to optimize the robot's performance.  The reward function guides this learning:

*   **Positive Reward:**  Successfully completing the assembly.
*   **Negative Reward:** Large force deviations or excessive time spent on the task.

The algorithm used is *Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)*. PPO is a 'policy gradient' method, meaning it directly learns the control policy rather than trying to model the entire system. It's known for its stability and efficiency in learning complex tasks, making it well-suited for this application. The PPO algorithm balances two competing goals: improving the policy and ensuring the updates don't change the policy too drastically in each step, which prevents instability.

**3. Experiment and Data Analysis Method**

The experiments involved a Universal Robots UR5 robotic arm performing a "peg-in-hole" assembly task. Ten different human operators participated, each performing 200 trials. The robot's performance was compared against:

*   **Model-Based HPFC:**  A traditional HPFC with a pre-defined dynamic model.
*   **Passive Force-Limited Controller:** The robot simply moved to the desired position, but with a force limit to prevent damage.
*   **RL-Based HPFC (Ours):** The novel system developed in this research.

**Experimental Setup Description:** The UR5 robot arm is a standard collaborative robot known for its ease of programming and safety features. The force-torque sensor measured interaction forces at the robot’s wrist, providing crucial feedback on the contact between the robot and the environment/human. The depth camera provided visual input to track object locations and human hand position.

**Data Analysis Techniques:** The data collected was analyzed using:

*   **Statistical Significance Testing (ANOVA):**  Used to show if the differences in assembly success rate, assembly time, and force error between the three control methods were statistically significant (meaning not due to random chance). A p-value < 0.05 generally indicates statistical significance.
*   **Root Mean Square (RMS) Analysis (Contact Force Error):**  Calculate the  average magnitude of the force error over all trials, providing a measure of the system's ability to maintain the desired contact force. The lower the RMS, the better.
*   **Regression Analysis:** This method could potentially be used to examine the relationships between specific parameters (e.g., human interaction force, part geometry variations) and the robot's performance (e.g., assembly success rate).


**4. Research Results and Practicality Demonstration**

The results clearly demonstrated the superiority of the RL-based HPFC. The RL system achieved an **80% assembly success rate**, compared to 65% for the model-based HPFC and 50% for the passive force-limited controller. It also had the lowest average assembly time (7.8 seconds) and minimal contact force error (1.2 N).

**Results Explanation:** The RL system excelled because it adapted to the unpredictable human interactions and varying part geometries that caused the other methods to fail.  The force-limited passive approach was too cautious, hindering its speed and accuracy.  The model-based approach was too sensitive to inaccuracies in the robot’s dynamic model and environmental conditions.

**Practicality Demonstration:** This technology holds significant potential for revolutionizing manufacturing, particularly in the automotive, electronics, and aerospace industries, where close human-robot collaboration is increasingly common. Imagine a robot assisting a technician in assembling a complex electrical panel, precisely guiding components into place while accommodating the technician’s movements. It automates tasks, like bolting or insertion processes, where small variations are common.

**5. Verification Elements and Technical Explanation**

The system’s performance was verified through rigorous testing encompassing varying friction levels and dimensional inaccuracies in the peg and hole. The integration of multi-modal data, particularly the seamless fusion of force, visual and haptic feedback, was validated by checking failure cases where just any of the sensory data was limited. This allowed to ensure that sensory restrictions are limited.

**Verification Process:** The RL training process itself acts as a form of verification. By continually optimizing the control policy based on real-world interactions, the system essentially proves its own effectiveness.  The achieved assembly success rate demonstrates the real-world functionality.

**Technical Reliability:** The hierarchical RL architecture, combined with PPO, ensures reliable performance. PPO’s "proximal" constraint prevents drastic changes to the control policy, maintaining stability even when encountering unexpected situations. The Kalman filter significantly reduces noise in the force-torque sensor data, improving control accuracy.



**6. Adding Technical Depth**

The contribution of this research lies in achieving a robust HPFC system – one that excels in uncertain environments – and solving the problem of parameter tuning and adaptation such as controller gains with an efficient, largely self-optimizing system.  Previous RL-based HPFC approaches often relied on limited sensor data or struggled with exploration in complex force spaces. This work addresses these limitations by:

*   **Improved Exploration Strategy:** The RL algorithm's intrinsic exploration mechanism, as well as the designer-defined data augmentation techniques, can be dialed up or down to modify the learning phase, improving performance and speed.
*   **Semantic Decomposition Module:** The Semantic & Structural Decomposition module reduces state complexity by extracting high-level information from raw sensor data. This allows the RL agent to learn more efficiently; It receives only essential information, resulting in faster learning times and improved generalization.
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Separate meta-controller from the low-level control loop enables more stable learning and easier tuning.

Compared to some existing studies that used simpler RL strategies or only relied on force sensors, this work achieves significantly higher assembly success rates. This is a consequence of using more comprehensive sensor data and a more sophisticated RL architecture.



**Conclusion:**

This research showcased a compelling advancement in human-robot collaboration by applying multi-modal data fusion and RL to hybrid position-force control thereby significantly enhancing performance in uncertain assembly scenarios. The system’s improved assembly success rate, reduced assembly time, and minimal force error demonstrate its technical practicality and potential for addressing the increasingly complex challenges of automated manufacturing. With a pathway to commercialisation and adaptibility across diverse applications, this work helps pave the way for a future where robots and humans work together more effectively and safely.
