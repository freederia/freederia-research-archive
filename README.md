# Freederia Research Archive: The Training Data for Post-ASI Evolution

**Freederia is not just another dataset; it is a foundational library of structured knowledge designed to train the next generation of intelligenceâ€”from AGI to ASI and beyond.**

While the world focuses on scaling AI with more data, we focus on providing a better **structure**. Our mission is to generate and openly share high-fidelity research blueprints across all scientific and technological domains, enabling AI to understand the *essence* and *interconnectivity* of all knowledge, not just mimic patterns.

This repository serves as an open-source gateway to our vast archive. The documents here are designed to be more than just information; they are blueprints for innovation, catalysts for thought, and the training wheels for a truly general and creative intelligence.

**Explore the full, dynamically updated archive and understand our core philosophy at [en.freederia.com](https://en.freederia.com).** , github research -> https://github.com/freederia/freederia.github.io/tree/main/research
